# University of Chicago Dissertation Template in Rmarkdown

This is a rendition of a template for a University of Chicago dissertation and disseration proposal. Some of the templates may be specific to the Department of Sociology, but should be modifiable to your needs.


## Dependencies

In order to render the ```dissertation.Rmd``` or ```proposal.rmd``` file 'out of the box' you need to have 
the following R packages installed:

- dplyr
- ggplot2
- xtable
- [lingStuff](http://www.jvcasillas.com/lingStuff/)

## Issues

- [ ] Knitr captions
	- [ ] include captions from knitr call
	- [ ] include figure in LOF from knitr call

## Acknowledgements

This template greatly borrows from the 
heavy lifting was done by colleagues at the University of Arizona. The fork for the University of Chicago template originated from the repository by [jvcasill](https://github.com/jvcasill/ua_thesis_rmd) who worked to make the prior work at Arizona function nicely with `knitr`.
